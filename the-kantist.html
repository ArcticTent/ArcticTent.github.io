            A mysterious accident helps you
            escape your cage in the laboratory.
            <br>
            You flee into the vents hoping to find some safety and freedom.

            On your way you meet several other test subjects, slimes, 
            modified rats and other creatures, 
            some are nice, some rather not. 
            <br>
            But that's not the only dangers waiting for you in the vents of the laboratory. 
            Thankfully, you yourself were designed in the lab to be a spy in 
            enemy facilities, that should help...

            <div class="sub-header">A leap into the unknown</div>
            It all started one peculiar night. You had some extra hard exercises
            during the day, so you were in a deep sleep on the little mattress 
            they put in your cage. It was a bit weird that they even took 
            the time to make a custom mattress for you, while neglecting most
            other things. But you weren't complaining, it was needed after their 
            usual experiments. 
            <br>
            You were dreaming of something... something nice... 
            but you don't remember anymore... and then, it happened.
            <br><br>
            BANG!!!
            <br><br>
            You jumped awake hit by a small shockwave, ears whining from the loud noise,
            the laboratory in flames in front of you. Bits and pieces of the glass wall 
            of your cage layed on the floor next to you.
            <br>
            To your left the vent cover was ripped into pieces and you spotted a 
            round silhouette in the shadows of the opening. 
            "What had happened?! An experiment gone wrong? There have been 
            problems, but it has never...". 
            <br>
            You tried to finish the thought but you 
            were ripped out of your head by a deep voice 
            coming from the vent:
            <br>
            "Come ... have to ... safety ... no time!"
            <br><br>
            You barely understood him, your ears were still ringing and there was lots
            of comotion in the lab, but you knew what the silhouette wanted. 
            You stepped closer and entered the vents. 
            <br><br>
            The silhouette revealed itself to be another slime, like you.
            But a dark brown in color and a little bigger than you. It wasn't the usual slime you
            had talked to through the vent cover before, that much you could tell.
            You were hesitant at first but he seemed like he wanted to help you and frankly,
            he was the best chance of freedom you've ever had. You couldn't throw this 
            away. He made an eye movement towards the darkness of the now smoke-filled
            vent and started walking, you followed. 
            <br><br>
            After some time you both ended up at a ledge. You don't know whether it was
            the darkness, the smoke or just the sheer bottomlessness of the vent-chasm
            in front of you, you just knew that there was no bottom in sight, 
            not even a hint of it.
            <br>
            You've had seen worse, but this ... this was new, this wasn't a controlled
            environment, there could be anything down there...
            <br>
            Suddenly, without saying a word, your companion jumped. 
            <br>
            You followed.
            <br><br>
            <b>...</b>
            <br><br><br>
            You'll be meeting new friends, fighting new foes and making new memories.
            But who knows what exactly the future has in store for you.
