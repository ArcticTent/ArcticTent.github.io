            Our Story:
        </h4>
        <div class="normal-text">
        The Story of Arctic Tent Studios began in 2019 when a few students came together and decided to combine their different ideas and... 
        well ... make games! It started out as some small school projects and prototypes, but over time became a bigger and bigger passion. 
        So much so that in 2021, we decided to take the first step and officially start our production on a full game release of a prototype that had been on our minds for a while. 
        Since then, we've embarked on an exciting adventure, overcoming challenges, celebrating successes, 
        and learning and growing with the project and coming ever closer to releasing it worldwide.

            Our Goal:
        </h4>
        <div class="normal-text">
        At Arctic Tent, our mission is simple: to craft exceptional games that captivate, inspire, and delight. 
        While everyone of our team is still a student working in their spare time, making the process of releasing games a bit slower, 
        we believe we can still convince with good storytelling and will try to immerse our players with attention to detail at all the right places.
